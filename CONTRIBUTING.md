# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Getting your pull request through
### Testing
An essential part of getting your change through is to make sure all existing tests pass.

#### Prerequisites
* Maven to build and run tests.
* A GCP project to test on with the compute engine API enabled with all relevant permissions
  enabled, especially billing. Running integration tests will also incur billing.
* For development, IntelliJ is recommended.
* **For Windows Images/VM's**, have Java and OpenSSH pre-installed. We have suggested
  startup-scripts for installing both if you do not want to pre-install,
  but pre-installing is advised.


#### Running the tests
* Write/change tests as necessary based on the code changes you made.
* Make sure you are at the directory where pom.xml is located.

##### Unit Tests
* Run the following: 
    ```
    mvn test
    ```

##### Integration Tests

Integration tests provision actual instances in a GCP project, run pipeline, take snapshot etc.
Therefore, they are disabled in the CI and expected to be executed by contributors in their laptop itself.

Reasons for disabling integration test in CI,
* getting provisioning GCP infra is not possible
* even if we did get a GCP infra setup in the CI, it is risky to expose that, as someone can abuse the CI.

By default, integration tests are skipped from the maven goals, need to enable using the `skipITs` property.

Steps to execute integration test
* Prepare VM images  
  (ideally we should automate this see idea [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/google-compute-engine-plugin/pull/492#discussion_r1892705637))  
  The jenkins agent images need to have java installed. We have a packer script to create the image and upload to your configured GCP project.
  The scripts are located in [testimages/linux](./testimages/linux)
  Navigate to the directory and execute,
  ```bash
  bash setup-gce-image.sh
  ```
  * The above agent image contains the `java` command is available in the PATH; which the plugin uses by default for launching the agent.
    This plugin also supports configuring up a custom path for java executable, and we have an integration test for that `ComputeEngineCloudNonStandardJavaIT`.
    If you would like to execute this test, please create an image with not having `java` on the path, but at a custom path `/usr/bin/non-standard-java`.  
    To create a non-standard java image, execute,
    ```bash
    bash setup-gce-image.sh non-standard-java
    ```
  If you want to delete the images or recreate them, use the arguments `--recreate` or `--delete`.

* Create a service account with relevant access - See [Refer to IAM Credentials](Home.md#iam-credentials)   

* Export these mandatory environment variable   
  ```bash
  export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
  export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/sa-key.json
  export GOOGLE_REGION=us-central1
  export GOOGLE_ZONE=us-central1-a
  export GOOGLE_SA_NAME=jenkins-agent-sa
  ```
* Run the integration tests as,  
  * Run all the tests   
    ```bash
    mvn verify -DskipITs=false
    ```
  * Run a specific test class  
    ```bash
    mvn clean test -Dtest=ComputeEngineCloudRestartPreemptedIT
    ```
  * Run a specific test method  
    ```bash
    mvn clean test -Dtest=ComputeEngineCloudRestartPreemptedIT#testIfNodeWasPreempted
    ```
  You can also debug the tests with surefire by passing `-Dmaven.surefire.debug=true` and in your IDE connect to remote debug port `8000`.

###### Windows Integration Test
* By default, the integration tests only use linux based agents for testing. If you make a
  windows-related change, or otherwise want to test that a change still works for windows agents,
  run the tests with the flag `-Dit.windows=true` like this:  
  ```bash
  mvn verify -Dit.windows=true
  ```
* You need to prepare the windows image before running the tests.  
  * More information on building your baseline windows image can be found [here](WINDOWS.md)  
      and an example powershell script for setup can be found [here](windows-it-install.ps1).  
  * In addition to the environment variables mentioned in the previous section, also export these variables too,  
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_BOOT_DISK_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id # will be the same as your project id
    export GOOGLE_BOOT_DISK_IMAGE_NAME=windows-image-name # will be the name of the image you created using packer in Google cloud console
    export GOOGLE_JENKINS_PASSWORD=password # will be the password you set when creating the image with packer, used for password based ssh authentication.
    ```
