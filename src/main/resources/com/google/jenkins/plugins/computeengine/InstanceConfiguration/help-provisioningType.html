    GCP offers three VM provisioning options, each with different availability, pricing, and termination policies.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Standard:</strong> Stable provisioning model with guaranteed availability by GCP SLAs.
            Higher pricing compared to Spot and Preemptible VMs.
            Use the "<code>Max Run Duration Seconds</code>" field to limit the instance duration and enable automatic deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Spot:</strong> Low-cost instances that may be terminated if resources are needed elsewhere. Availability varies.
            Unlike Preemptible VMs, they are not always terminated after 24 hours.
            Spot and Preemptible VMs are priced the same.
            Use the "<code>Max Run Duration Seconds</code>" field to ensure termination after a specific duration.
            <p>
                See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/spot">Spot VMs</a> for more details.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Preemptible:</strong> Low-cost instances that may be terminated if resources are needed for other tasks.
            Availability varies. Spot and Preemptible VMs are priced the same.
            The "<code>Max Run Duration Seconds</code>" field does not apply to Preemptible instances.
            <p>
                See the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible">Preemptible VM Instances</a> documentation for more information.
